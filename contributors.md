In this list, you can indicate whether you'd like to join in. So far, the following 'roles' exist (of course, this can change as we discuss the project, but we need to start somewhere :-)):

- **Curator**: Curators are mainly responsibly for which chapters/sections/fragments should be covered and with which keywords. The curators also curate the hierarchy of keywords. To be a curator, you'd need to have quite a good overview of the research from a bird's eye perspective.
- **Author**: Authors write chapters/sections/fragments about specific topics. To be an author, you need to have a strong basis in methodology/statistics as well as in the topic area. You should value figuring out how people work over promoting a specific theoretical perspective: in other words, if you'd be reluctant to write in the chapter that theory X, which has dominated the field for decades, is weakly (or not) supported by evidence (should it not be), you might want to choose a different topic :-)

Note that you can just indicate what you'd like to do/what you'd be available for. This is, after all, a collaborative project: so we'll all be able to learn from each other, hopefully.

Just add your name, topic(s), and what you'd be willing & able to contribute to.

Of course, feel free to discuss any aspect of this page and this list at our Gitter page!
